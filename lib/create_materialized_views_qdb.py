"""
QuestDB Materialized Views Creation Script

This script creates and manages materialized views in QuestDB for trading data analysis.
It handles the creation of OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) aggregated views with
15-second intervals for efficient querying and analysis.

Features:
- Creates trades_ohlc_15s materialized view with 15-second OHLC aggregation
- Handles dropping and recreating existing views
- Uses environment variables from qdb.env for database connection
- Provides error handling and logging

Usage:
    python create_materialized_views_qdb.py

Requirements:
    - QuestDB running and accessible
    - qdb.env file with database connection parameters
    - psycopg2 library installed
    - python-dotenv library installed

Environment Variables (from qdb.env):
    - DB_HOST: QuestDB host (default: localhost)
    - DB_USER: Database user (default: admin)
    - DB_PASSWORD: Database password (default: quest)
    - QUESTDB_PG_PORT: PostgreSQL wire protocol port (default: 8812)
